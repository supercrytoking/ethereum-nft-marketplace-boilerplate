# 👷‍♂️ `ethereum-boilerplate`

> React components and hooks for fast building dApps without running own backend

This boilerplate is built on [react-moralis](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/react-moralis) and [Moralis](https://moralis.io/). Also has its own context provider for quick access to `chainId` or `ethAddress`

Please check the [official documentation of Moralis](https://docs.moralis.io/#user) for all the functionalities of Moralis.
