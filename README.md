# `ethereum-boilerplate-NFT-Marketplace`

> React components and hooks for fast building dApps without running own backend

This boilerplate is built on [react-moralis](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/react-moralis) and [Moralis](https://moralis.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ethereum-boilerplate). Also has its own context provider for quick access to `chainId` or `ethAddress`

There are many components in this boilerplate that do not require an active web3 provider, they use Moralis Web3 API. Moralis supports the most popular blockchains and their test networks. You can find a list of all available networks in [Moralis Supported Chains](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3-sdk/intro#supported-chains)

Please check the [official documentation of Moralis](https://docs.moralis.io/#user) for all the functionalities of Moralis.

# 🚀 Quick Start

📄 Clone or fork `ethereum-boilerplate`:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-boilerplate/ethereum-boilerplate.git
```
💿 Install all dependencies:
```sh
cd ethereum-boilerplate
yarn install 
```
✏ Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the main folder and provide your `appId` and `serverUrl` from Moralis ([How to start Moralis Server](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/getting-started/create-a-moralis-server)) 
Example:
```jsx
REACT_APP_MORALIS_APPLICATION_ID = xxxxxxxxxxxx
REACT_APP_MORALIS_SERVER_URL = https://xxxxxx.grandmoralis.com:2053/server
```

🔎 Locate the MoralisDappProvider in `src/providers/MoralisDappProvider/MoralisDappProvider.js` and paste the marketplace smart contract address and ABI
```jsx
const [contractABI, setContractABI] = useState();
const [marketAddress, setMarketAddress] = useState();
```

🔃 Sync the `MarketItemCreated` event from your `/src/contracts/marketplaceBoilerplate.sol` contract with your Moralis Server, making the tableName `MarketItems`
```jsx
event MarketItemCreated (
  uint indexed itemId,
  address indexed nftContract,
  uint256 indexed tokenId,
  address seller,
  address owner,
  uint256 price,
  bool sold
);
```


🚴‍♂️ Run your App:
```sh
yarn start
